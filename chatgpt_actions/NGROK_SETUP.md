üîê NGROK SETUP GUIDE - GET HTTPS FOR CHATGPT ACTIONS

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Free Account
1. Visit: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. Sign up (completely free!)
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get Your Auth Token
1. Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
2. Copy the authtoken (looks like: 2abc123def456...)

### Step 3: Configure ngrok
Run this command with YOUR token:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 4: Start HTTPS Tunnel
```bash
ngrok http 8081
```

### Step 5: Use HTTPS URL in ChatGPT Actions
You'll get an HTTPS URL like: https://abc123.ngrok.io
Use: https://abc123.ngrok.io/openapi.json in ChatGPT Actions

## Why This Works
- ‚úÖ ChatGPT Actions requires HTTPS (not HTTP)
- ‚úÖ ngrok creates secure HTTPS tunnel to your local server
- ‚úÖ Free ngrok account gives you stable HTTPS URLs
- ‚úÖ Your local AI stays private, just accessible via HTTPS

## Alternative: Continue Without HTTPS
If you prefer not to use ngrok, I can show you how to:
1. Add self-signed HTTPS to your local server, OR
2. Use a different approach for ChatGPT integration
